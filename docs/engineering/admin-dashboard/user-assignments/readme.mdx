title: User Assignments

## User (Practitioner) Assignments
The current user (practitioner) assignment consists of 4 main elements
- **User (Practitioner)** - This is the person using the application to collect data and execute workflows
- **CareTeam** - Caregiving users would be assigned here.
- **Team (Organization)** - Teams would be added to CareTeams as managing organizations.
- **Location** - Teams would be assigned to locations and by doing so, users would be assigned to their workstations.

Every user who is _“correctly”_ assigned as per the current implementation must have at least 1 of each of the 4 elements. These assignment information has an associated effect to how data is [synced down](/engineering/backend/info-gateway/data-sync) to the mobile applications.

These elements are then downloaded to the OpenSRP 2.0 mobile application via the **PractitionerDetail** endpoint.  This is a custom endpoint built by the OpenSRP team, it aggregates all the data related to a user and returns as one response.
